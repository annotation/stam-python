STAM Python Binding - API Documentation
=========================================

`STAM <https:/github.com/annotation/stam>`_ is a data model for stand-off text
annotation and described in detail `here <https://github.com/annotation/stam>`_.
This is a python library (to be more specific; a python binding written in
Rust) to work with the model.

This library offers a higher-level interface than the underlying Rust library. 
We aim to implement the full model and most extensions.
