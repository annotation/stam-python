"""
[STAM](https://github.com/annotation/stam) is a data model for stand-off text
annotation and described in detail [here](https://github.com/annotation/stam).
This is a python library (to be more specific; a python binding written in
Rust) to work with the model.

**What can you do with this library?**

* Keep, build and manipulate an efficient in-memory store of texts and annotations on texts
* Search in annotations, data and text:
    * Search annotations by data, textual content, relations between text fragments (overlap, embedding, adjacency, etc),
    * Search in text (incl. via regular expressions) and find annotations targeting found text selections.
    * Search in data (set,key,value) and find annotations that use the data.
    * Elementary text operations with regard for text offsets (splitting text on a delimiter, stripping text).
    * Convert between different kind of offsets (absolute, relative to other structures, UTF-8 bytes vs unicode codepoints, etc)
* Read and write resources and annotations from/to STAM JSON, STAM CSV, or an optimised binary (CBOR) representation
    * The underlying [STAM model](https://github.com/annotation/stam) aims to be clear and simple. It is flexible and 
      does not commit to any vocabulary or annotation paradigm other than stand-off annotation.

This STAM library is intended as a foundation upon which further applications
can be built that deal with stand-off annotations on text. We implement all 
the low-level logic in dealing this so you no longer have to and can focus on your 
actual application.

            A python dictionary containing configuration parameters:

                Use the `@include` mechanism to point to external files, if unset, all data will be kept in a single STAM JSON file.
            * debug: Optional[bool], default: False
                Enable debug mode, outputs extra information to standard error output (verbose!)
            * annotation_annotation_map: Optional[bool], default: True
                Enable/disable index for annotations that reference other annotations
            * resource_annotation_map: Optional[bool], default: True
                Enable/disable reverse index for TextResource => Annotation. Holds only annotations that **directly** reference the TextResource (via [`crate::Selector::ResourceSelector`]), i.e. metadata
            * dataset_annotation_map: Optional[bool], default: True
                Enable/disable reverse index for AnnotationDataSet => Annotation. Holds only annotations that **directly** reference the AnnotationDataSet (via [`crate::Selector::DataSetSelector`]), i.e. metadata
            * textrelationmap: Optional[bool], default: True

            * generate_ids: Optional[bool], default: False
                Generate pseudo-random public identifiers when missing (during deserialisation). Each will consist of 21 URL-friendly ASCII symbols after a prefix of A for Annotations, S for DataSets, D for AnnotationData, R for resources
            * strip_temp_ids: Optional[bool], default: True
                Strip temporary IDs during deserialisation. Temporary IDs start with an exclamation mark, a capital ASCII letter denoting the type, and a number

                Milestone placement interval (in unicode codepoints) in indexing text resources. A low number above zero increases search performance at the cost of memory and increased initialisation time.

    A *Selector* identifies the target of an annotation and the part of the
    target that the annotation applies to. Selectors can be considered the labelled edges of the graph model, tying all nodes together.
    There are multiple types of selectors, all captured in this class. There are several static methods available to instantiate a specific type of selector.

class TextSelectionOperator:
    """
    The TextSelectionOperator, simply put, allows comparison of two :class:`TextSelection' instances. It
    allows testing for all kinds of spatial relations (as embodied by this enum) in which two
    :class:`TextSelection` instances can be.
   
    Rather than operator on single :class:`TextSelection` instances, te implementation goes a bit
    further and can act also on the basis of multiple :class:`TextSelection` as a set;
    allowing you to compare two sets, each containing possibly multiple TextSelections, at once.

    The operator is instantiated via one of its static methods.
