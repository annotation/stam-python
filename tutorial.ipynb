    "# STAM Tutorial: Standoff Text Annotation for Pythonistas\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "[STAM](https://github.com/annotation/stam) is a data model, and accompanied\n",
    "tooling, for stand-off text annotation that allows researchers and developers\n",
    "to model annotations on text.\n",
    "\n",
    "An *annotation* is any kind of remark, classification/tagging on any particular\n",
    "portion(s) of a text, on the resource or annotation set as a whole, in which\n",
    "case we can interpret annotations as *metadata*, or on another annotation\n",
    "(*higher-order annotation*).\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of annotation may be linguistic annotation, structure/layout\n",
    "annotation, editorial annotation, technical annotation, or whatever comes to\n",
    "mind. STAM does not define any vocabularies whatsoever. Instead, it provides a\n",
    "framework upon which you can model your annotations using whatever\n",
    "you see fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is thoroughly explained [in its specification\n",
    "document](https://github.com/annotation/stam/blob/master/README.md). We\n",
    "summarize only the most important data structures here, these have direct\n",
    "counterparts (classes) in the python library we will be teaching in this\n",
    "tutorial: \n",
    "\n",
    "* `Annotation`  - A instance of annotation. Associated with an annotation is a\n",
    "  `Selector` to select the target of the annotation, and one or more\n",
    "  `AnnotationData` instances that hold the *body* or *content* of the\n",
    "  annotation. This is explicitly decoupled from the annotation instance itself\n",
    "  as multiple annotations may hold the very same content.\n",
    "* `Selector` - A selector identifies the target of an annotation and the part of the target that the annotation applies to. There are multiple types that are described [here](https://github.com/annotation/stam/blob/master/README.md#class-selector). The `TextSelector` is an important one that selects a target resource and a specific text selection within it by specifying an offset. \n",
    "* `AnnotationData` - A key/value pair that acts as *body* or *content* for one or more annotations. The key is a reference to `DataKey`, the value is a `DataValue`. (The term *feature* is also seen for this in certain annotation paradigms)\n",
    "* `DataKey` - A key as referenced by `AnnotationData`.\n",
    "* `DataValue` - A value with some type information (e.g. string, integer, float).\n",
    "* `TextResource` - A textual resource that is made available for annotation. This holds the actual textual content.\n",
    "* `TextSelection` - A particular selection of text within a resource, i.e. a subslice of the text.\n",
    "* `AnnotationDataSet` - An Annotation Data Set stores the keys (`DataKey`) and\n",
    "  values (`AnnotationData`) that are used by annotations. It effectively\n",
    "  defines a certain vocabulary, i.e. key/value pairs. How broad or narrow the\n",
    "  scope of the vocabulary is not defined by STAM but entirely up to the user. \n",
    "* `AnnotationStore` - The annotation store is essentially your *workspace*, it holds all\n",
    "  resources, annotation sets (i.e. keys and annotation data) and of course the\n",
    "  actual annotations. In the Python implementation it is a memory-based store\n",
    "  and you can put as much as you like into it (as long as it fits in memory).\n",
    "\n",
    "STAM is more than just a theoretical model, we offer practical implementations\n",
    "that allow you to work with it directly. In this tutorial we will be using Python and\n",
    "the Python library `stam`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: The STAM Python library is a so-called Python binding to a STAM library\n",
    "written in Rust. This means the library is not written in Python but is\n",
    "compiled to machine code and as such offers much better performance.\n",
    "\n",

    "First of all, you will need to install the STAM Python library from the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/stam/) as follows:"
